# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 46 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It has a "Billards Game" Part 1 project. It is coded in javascript using "firebase" and "p5.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file. In making this project, I have also taken help from youtube, matter.js documentation, Stackoverflow, p5.js Documentation and Github Repositories.
